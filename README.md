this file is the file I used in my astrophysics research. I was comparing frequencys in a fourier transform to see if
there were equal spacings between them (harmonics).

The first step is to create a txt file with the frequencies you want to compare, then copy the location of the file to 
the program. Then it will compare the delta values between 1 and 2 rows.
